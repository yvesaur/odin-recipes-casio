        Papaitan is a famous Ilocano soup dish mostly composed of cow or goat innards. 
        The name of this dish was derived from the Filipino word “Pait”, which means “bitter”. 
        The bitter taste of this soup comes from the bile. This is a bitter juice extracted by 
        the liver and stored in the gallbladder to aid digestion.
